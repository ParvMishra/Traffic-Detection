The objective of this project is to analyze the video of traffic on a road and based on the density (i.e. 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler vehicles count) in each lane adjust the traffic light timings.
I have used the OpenCV library (ultralytics YOLO8) to detect the lanes and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) library to count the vehicles in each lane.
Using that count I have calculated the density for each lane to adjust the traffic light timings which helps in optimizing traffic flow and reduces congestion.
